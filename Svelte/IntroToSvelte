What problem does Svetle solve/Why Svetle?

- Svetle is a tool what allows us to build lightweight javascript applications. The code is very small in size, but executes a lot faster, giving us a faster application.
- Svetle is building reactive user interfaces in the web

**Svetle is a COMPILER not a framework
- Because Svetle is not a framework, there is no extra code to be shipped, instead it compiles your code at build-time
- The advantage is that it ships less code than react or angular

1. You write normal javascript code by following a Svetle syntax
2. Svetle compiles your code to optimzed runtime instructions, then only ships code your app really needs
3. In the browser: compiled code executes and (re-)renders user interfaces
