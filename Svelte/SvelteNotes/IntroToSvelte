*** What problem does Svetle solve/Why Svetle? ***

- Svetle is a tool what allows us to build lightweight javascript applications. The code is very small in size, but executes a lot faster, giving us a faster application.
- Svetle is building reactive user interfaces in the web

**Svetle is a COMPILER not a framework
- Because Svetle is not a framework, there is no extra code to be shipped, instead it compiles your code at build-time
- The advantage is that it ships less code than react or angular

1. You write normal javascript code by following a Svetle syntax
2. Svetle compiles your code to optimzed runtime instructions, then only ships code your app really needs
3. In the browser: compiled code executes and (re-)renders user interfaces

Svetle apps are built from multiple components - UI building blocks. It follows the same philosophy as in React, Angular, Vue

- Svetle always removes the last element

*** Svetle Reactivity ***

- you should always reassign a variable if you want svelte to update the DOM in order to change it
- the equal sign is the trigger which will tell svelte to change it

* Event Modifiers
- event modifiers are set with | and then a method
- method such as |once, |passive, |capture, |stopPropagation, |preventDefault

* Inline function
